section_2_left_text: >-
  Creating a bespoke software solution has many benefits, the most obvious one
  being you end up with a solution which is entirely tailored to your needs. You
  will not be paying for unnecessary functionality or annual subscription fees
  and being at the behest of the supplier to provide enhancements or bug fixes.

section_3_text: >-
  Delivery of bespoke solutions requires technologies to be chosen carefully.
  Our expertise and experience allows us to identify and select technologies
  that will support and enhance your business objectives.
