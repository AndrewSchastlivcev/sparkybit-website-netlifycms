Hello, reader!

In this article we will focus on preparing for one of the most popular certifications for western market: Sales Cloud Consultant. Let's take a brief look at what Sales Cloud is and why this certification is considered one of the most relevant by western recruiting sites.

\
Salesforce Sales Cloud is an online system for managing business processes, customer relations, analytics, marketing and sales. Salesforce developers understand that for successful sales it’s not enough to have good management - you need a large-scale CRM system that works on any device with convenient access to Chatter, CRM, custom applications and the entire flow of business processes. The service allows you to create and configure any applications, deploy the necessary functionality and manage the company's budget.

\
According to the product description, it becomes clear why Sales Cloud certification has a high value in the western market. Knowledge in this area will allow you to manage it and be a sought-after specialist. A prerequisite is a condition of having an admin certificate.\
Now let's actually proceed to the preparation for certification. In my case, preparation for the exam took about 1 month of real time.\
The Salesforce Sales Cloud Consultant exam measures candidate’s knowledge and skills related to the following objectives. A candidate should have hands-on experience implementing Sales Cloud solutions and have demonstrated the application of each of the features/functions below:

**Industry Knowledge: 7%**

**Implementation Strategies: 12%**

**Sales Cloud Solution Design: 21%**

**Marketing and Leads: 8%**

**Account and Contact Management: 13%**

**Opportunity Management: 13%**

**Sales Productivity: 9%**

**Sales Cloud Analytics: 9%**

**Integration and Data Management: 8%**

I was preparing for the official trailmix and help. You need to pay attention to the next topics: Territory Management, Person Accounts, Manage Multiple Currencies, Sales Cloud Einstein. You should know the first 3 topics quite deeply, given the features, which we will talk about a little bit later. Sales Cloud Einstein requires an understanding of basic things, such as the main features and their usage. It was these 4 topics that I had most of the questions. But, of course, other topics would also need your attention.

Now let's move on to the dessert - the questions from the certification itself. Here, some real questions that I met during the certification will be considered. Questions will be slightly changed, but their essence will remain the same.

1. Company wants to implement a process to determine which current leads have the most in common with leads that have been converted before? How a company can to do that?

a) Use Einstein Lead Scoring \
\
b) Create a Lead Rollup Summary Field

c) Create a joined report

d) Use Lead Conversion Reporting.

According to official help: ”*Einstein analyzes your past leads, including any custom fields, to determine which current leads have the most in common with leads that have previously converted.*” So, the the correct answer is - а) Use Einstein Lead Scoring.

2. Which roll-up summary fields are supported between objects, when enabling Advanced Currency Management?

a) Opportunity object to Account in the default currency of the user’s manager.

b) Campaign object to Opportunity object.

с) Opportunity line object to Product object in the default currency of the org.

d) Opportunity line object to Opportunity object.\
\
According to official documentation: «*For example, roll-up summary fields are supported from an opportunity line item object to its opportunity object, because both are advanced currency management enabled.*»\
So, the correct answer is - d) Opportunity line object to Opportunity object.

3. Company wants to implement Territory Management. The main idea – organizing Territories based on their characteristics.\
How to do that?

a) Create a Territory Model with Territory Hierarchy and set allocations b) Create Territory Types with priority and then create а Territory based on Territory Types.

с) Create a Territory Hierarchy and set allocations and assignments.

d) Create a Territory Management Model with Territory Hierarchy and with priority.

When you create a territory, you select a territory type from the Territory Type lookup field.We also can look and set its priority through Territory Type.Therefore, the correct solution to this requirement is first to create Territory Types with priority, and only then create a Territory and bind it to the desired Territory Type with the corresponding priority.

The correct answer is b) Create Territory Types with priority and then create a Territory based on Territory Types.

4. Company has a lot of duplicate Person Accounts. How developer can merge them?

a) Person Accounts can be merged only with other Person Accounts\
\
 b) Person Accounts can be merged automatically by enabling the option in Account Setup

c) Person Accounts can be merged with Contact

d) Person Accounts can be merged with any object

And here again we turn to the official documentation : «*As with merging other kinds of records, person accounts can be merged only with other person accounts*.»\
So, the correct answer is - а) Person Accounts can be merged only with other Person Accounts

5. Choose 3 considerations about Kanban view.

a) Kanban view can display rollup summaries for currency fields

b) Kanban view can summarize records by currency fields

c) Kanban view shows amounts in the user’s currrency

d) Kanban view can show a maximum of 200 records

e) Kanban сards can show up to 10 fields.\
\
Accorging to official help: “*The Kanban view displays a maximum of 200 cards. Kanban cards display a maximum of four fields. If you’ve enabled multiple currencies, the Kanban view displays amounts in the user’s currency. Summaries can be created only for numeric and currency fields that aren’t roll-up summary or formula fields.*” So, correct answers are:

b) Kanban view can summarize records by currency fields

c) Kanban view shows amounts in the user’s currrency

d) Kanban view can show a maximum of 200 records.

Here is a brief summary of what awaits you at the certification. For me, it turned out to be one of the most difficult, so you should definitely not underestimate its complexity. In the end, I would like to advise you to read the questions carefully, because they often already contain the answer. \

I hope this short review will help you pass this certification successfully!
